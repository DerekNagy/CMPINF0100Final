### Context

Unfortunately, Pittsburgh is kind of trash all around. Wherever you go, you'll always see something, whether it's funny, stupid, violent, or weird. We decided that, despite all this, we care about 3 main things - Arrest Data, Neighborhood Census, and Social Services. We want the least violence, the most people, and the most events. Why? We don't want crime, we want more friends, and we want to do things outside of work. Pretty simple.
