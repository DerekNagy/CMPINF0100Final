The second factor would be percentage of the population in Pittsburgh. As Pittsburgh is a diverse city, diversity is going to have a fair impact on determining the best neighborhood. The last factor is Social Events per neighborhood. This factor will have a slight influence on our choice in determinig the best neighborhood as in determining a neighborhood we need to see its social vitality and community engagement."
